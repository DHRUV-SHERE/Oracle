            <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle Database</a></h2>
            <p><b>Release 10:</b> In 2004, Oracle Corporation shipped release 10g (g standing for "grid") as the then latest version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle Database</a>. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Application_Server">Oracle Application Server</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_EE">Java EE</a> integrated with the server part of that version of the database, making it possible to deploy web-technology applications. The application server was the first middle-tier software designed for grid computing. The interrelationship between Oracle 10g and Java allowed developers to set up stored procedures written in the Java language, as well as, those written in the traditional Oracle database programming language, PL/SQL.)[citation needed]</p>
        
            <p><b>Release 11:</b> Release 11g became available in 2007. Oracle Corporation released Oracle Database 11g Release 2 in September 2009. This version was available in    four commercial editions—Enterprise Edition, Standard Edition, Standard Edition One, and Personal Edition—and in one free edition—the Express Edition. The     licensing of these editions shows various restrictions and obligations that were called complex by licensing expert Freirich Florea.[28] The Enterprise     Edition (DB EE), the most expensive of the Database Editions, has the fewest restrictions—but nevertheless has complex licensing. Oracle Corporation    constrains the Standard Edition (DB SE) and Standard Edition One (SE1) with more licensing restrictions, in accordance with their lower price.</p>

            <p><b>Release 12:</b> Release 12c (c standing for "cloud") became available on July 1, 2013.</p>
